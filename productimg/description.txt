ZSSC3281 Dual-Channel Resistive Sensor Signal Conditioner IC with Analog Output

img1

ZSSC3281 is a dual-path SSC IC for highly accurate amplification, digitization, and sensor-specific correction of sensor signals. It is suitable for bridge and half-bridge sensors as well as external voltage-source element and single-element sensors (e.g., Pt100 and external temperature sensor diodes) powered by an on-chip current source.
Digital compensation of the sensor offset,sensitivity, temperature drift, and non-linearity is accomplished via a 32-bit Arm® M3-based math core running a correction algorithm with calibration coefficients stored in a non-volatile, reprogrammable memory. The programmable, integrated sensor front-end allows the optimal application of various
sensors for a broad range of applications.
